# Dalgarno-Detective
Discovering the consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence based on genes in E.Coli  ðŸ§¬

# Overview
The Shine-Dalgarno sequence is a 6-nucleotide region within the gene ~5 nucleotides upstream of the start codon, ATG. The ribosome leverages this Shine sequence to bind to the mRNA, to translate it into a functional protein. 

The consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence is AGGAGG. However, this varies with each gene. The goal of this project is to determine whether we obtain this same consensus sequence based on 20 random genes from an E.Coli variant. 

Genes used in this project can be found using the following link: [EcoCyc](https://ecocyc.org/genbro/genbro.shtml?orgid=ECOLI&replicon=COLI-K12)

# Findings
In the 20 E.Coli genes observed, the same consensus Shine-Dalgarno sequence was detected!
